For my PoE I've created a GUI that prompts the user to play a Quiz or use the same chat bot from the previous parts.
So the program starts with the prompt
If the user selects the Quiz then the quiz will initilaise 
There are 10 questions for the user to answer and a little friend to moniter their progress.
If the user opens the chat bot then they are met with a familiar set up with some added details 
Inputing Hello into the chat will start the regular proccess 
The Chatbot will still ask the user what topic they're intersted in and the response is: I'm interested in ...
The Chatbot also keeps a log of the activitys done on the previous day if asked: show me yesterday's log
Also the Chatbot can create reminders if inputed: remind me in (set a time frame)
Both the Chatbot and the Quiz have a return button to return to the startup menu.
